**How To Train Your Dragon** all 1, 2, and 3
It's about a young, wimpy viking boy named hiccup, who caught himself a dragon which he severely affected his ability to fly, and so he helped him by making a tail for the dragon, but in order for the tail to work, he has to get on him and control him. So he tame and trained the dragon he evidently named Toothless.
